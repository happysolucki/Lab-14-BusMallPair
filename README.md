This collaberation was completed by Brandon Keefer and Lizzy Rhodes.






 Observations overall: There is a lot more that I need to review as far as objects and functions are concerned. the protoype method was difficult for me to understand since using ES6 classes was easier to understand. some things to remember for next time:

 1. Don't get thrown by the Protoypes, they are just methods inside of our constructor notation

 2.   These are the two most **important** terms when using local storage: *JSON.stringify* is to turn our data into a useable string and *JSON.parse* is to turn our data back into JS data.

 3. The *for/in* statement loops through the **properties of an object**.

 4. 'tableBody.innerHTML = "";' <=== adding an empty string in HTML will  delete what is selected.
